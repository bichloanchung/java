Create a java program. Your program should have an array of booleans of length 10 that will represent peopleâ€™s opinion about a new they read on facebook.
The data that will be inserted on the array will be generated by using the random.nextBoolean() method inside a for loop.
After generating the values, print how many people believe that the new is real and print how many people thinks the new is a hoax.
